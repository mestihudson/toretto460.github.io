**BRING CSS INLINE**

>All CSS needs to be inline for HTML emails. For ease of editing, we’ve kept the CSS separate. When you’re ready to send your email, you’ll want to use a CSS inliner tool, such as MailChimp’s or Premailer, among others. Many email campaign tools such as Campaign Monitor will do this for you automatically.
